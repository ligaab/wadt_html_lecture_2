<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
<p>Two households, both alike in dignity,</p>
<p>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</p>
<p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p>
<p>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</p>
<p>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</p>
<p>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</p>
<p>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</p>
<p>Do with their death bury their parents' strife.</p>
<p>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</p>
<p>And the continuance of their parents' rage,</p>
<p>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,</p>
<p>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</p>
<p>The which if you with patient ears attend,</p>
<p>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
<h2>ACT I</h2>
<p>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</p>
<p>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</p>
<p>SAMPSON Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
<p>GREGORY No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
<p>SAMPSON I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.</p>
<p>GREGORY Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.</p>
<p>Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR</p>
<p>ABRAHAM Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p>
<p>SAMPSON I do bite my thumb, sir.</p>
<p>They fight</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Part, fools! Put up your swords; you know not what you do.</p>

<p>CAPULET</p>
<p>What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!</p>
<p>TYBALT</p>
<p>Why, what is Tybalt? Here there be servants of the house of Montague.</p>
<p>CAPULET</p>
<p>What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,</p>
<p>As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:</p>
<p>Have at thee, coward!</p>
<p>They fight. Enter PETER, and others with Musick</p>
<p>BENVOLIO</p>
<p>What, ho! you men, you beasts, that quench the fire of your pernicious rage</p>
<p>With purple fountains issuing from your veins,</p>
<p>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands</p>
<p>Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground,</p>
<p>And hear the sentence of your moved prince.</p>
<p>PRINCE</p>
<p>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,</p>
<p>Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—</p>
<p>Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,</p>
<p>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage</p>
<p>With purple fountains issuing from your veins,</p>
<p>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands</p>
<p>Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground,</p>
<p>And hear the sentence of your moved prince.</p>
